Title: Statistical Analysis of High Throughput Proteomics Data
Description: Provides methods for making inference in isobaric labelled LC-MS/MS experiments, i.e. iTRAQ experiments. It provides a function that reasonably parses a CSV-export from Proteome Discoverer(TM) into a data frame that can be easily handled in R. Functions and methods are provided for quality control, filtering, norming, and the calculation of response variables for further analysis. The merging of multiple iTRAQ experiments with respect to a reference is also covered.
