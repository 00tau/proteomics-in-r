{"name":"Proteomics in R","tagline":"Statistical Analysis of High Throughput Proteomics Data","body":"The R-package proteomics\r\n========================\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis is an R-package for the Statistical Analysis of High Throughput Proteomics\r\nData. The package provides methods for making inference in isobaric labelled\r\nLC-MS/MS experiments, namely iTRAQ experiments. It provides a function that\r\nreasonably parses a CSV-export from Proteome Discoverer(TM) into a data frame\r\nthat can be easily handled in R. Functions and methods are provided for quality\r\ncontrol, filtering, norming, and the calculation of response variables for\r\nfurther analysis. The merging of multiple iTRAQ experiments with respect to a\r\nreference is also covered.\r\n\r\nInstallation from CRAN\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install the package in a running R environment is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninstall.packages(\"proteomics\")\r\nlibrary(\"proteomics\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstallation manually from GitHub\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nAfter cloning the repository, you may use the following magic in the build\r\ndirectory to build and install the package on your system:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake package\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen open up an R-session and type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(\"proteomics\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you are good to go.\r\n\r\nWhere to start\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nA small tutorial will be soon appearing here.\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n------\r\n\r\nThomas W.
